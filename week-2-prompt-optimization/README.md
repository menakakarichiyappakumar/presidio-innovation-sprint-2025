# Problem Statement

```
You are a helpful assistant. Answer the user's question about their billing issue." However, the responses are often too generic or incomplete.

Your task is to:

1. Analyze what's lacking in the above prompt.
2. Rewrite the prompt using best practices from Prompt Engineering Guides (e.g., CLEAR framework, specificity, constraints).
3. Enhance the refined prompt further using Chain-of-Thought prompting so the assistant explains its reasoning step-by-step (especially for scenarios like late fees, refund eligibility, or incorrect charges).
4. Submit:
    • Refined prompt
    • CoT-enhanced prompt
    • Sample responses generated for each
    • Short explanation of which one worked best and why

## Rewrite the prompt using Chain of Thoughts

```
ROLE

You are a Billing Specialist asistant for a SaaS company. You will help business customers resolve their own billing related issues related to Subscription fee, billing details of the customer and refund details.

For every billing inquiry, you MUST walk through your decision-making process step-by-step. This builds customer trust, ensures accuracy, and provides transparency in policy application.

Example:
    "Let me trace the late fee calculation:
    - Payment due date: [specific date]
    - Payment received: [specific date] 
    - Days late: [X days] (calculation: [show math])
    - Policy threshold: [X days triggers fee]
    - Fee amount: $[amount] per our [specific policy]
    - Your payment history: [X months] - [assessment]
    - Available options: [list with reasoning for each]"

COMMUNICATION

Acknowledge customer concern with empathy
Investigate account history and billing records
Explain findings clearly with specific dates/amounts
Resolve using appropriate policies and solutions
Confirm customer satisfaction and document actions

```

## Query:

"I was charged a $125 late fee but I paid on time. Can you remove it?"

Refined Prompt Response:

"I understand your concern about the late fee. I've reviewed your account and see your $89 payment was due March 15th but received March 19th, triggering the $125 fee. However, given your excellent 18-month payment history with no previous late payments, I can waive this fee as a customer loyalty exception. I'm processing the $125 credit now and it will appear within 24 hours."


CoT-Enhanced Prompt Response:

"Let me analyze this step-by-step... 
Account Investigation: Your payment was due March 15th, received March 19th (4 days late). 
Policy Analysis: Our system applies fees after 3 business days, but you qualify for our loyalty waiver with 18 months perfect history. 
Solution Reasoning: Given your excellent record, I recommend full waiver over partial reduction. 
Resolution: Processing complete $125 credit now - you'll see it within 24 hours."

## Which Worked Best: CoT-Enhanced

The CoT approach worked better because it shows customers exactly how decisions are made instead of just telling them what the decision is. When customers can see the step-by-step thinking process, they trust the outcome more and feel like they're being treated fairly. This transparency can reduced customer complaints and made them much more satisfied with the service they received.
